Our plugin has a lot of nice and unique features that you will like. You can add Repeating Timers, Popups, CountUps and much more. Also, our plugin integrated with WooCommerce, so you can use it on WooCommerce websites. 

For adding timers you need to do some simple steps. First of all, go to your WordPress website administration panel and find from the left side menu our plugin. Open our plugin page and click on the "Add New" button.
First of all, type the title and then configure other settings. Choose the type. There are 4 main types - single and personal timer, single and personal count-up. The second field is the "End Date"(for count-up, there is also another field "Start Date"). and the last one is the Time Zone option. It is a great option and we advise to use it.
From the second tab of this page, you can configure the action after the time ends. There are 4 options, first one will just hide the timer, second will show text. Also, there are other two options - repeat and redirect. Most users use the last two options.
From the last tab, you will find an option "Before Count up start". After you configure all settings, just click on the save button.

Then go to the themes page. You will see 4 tabs on the themes page. The first one is the "General Settings", the other 3 are the Standard, Vertical and Circle timers settings tabs.
From the general settings choose the design type(as we mentioned Standard, Vertical or Circle type). Then choose the width metrical type(px/%) and after that type the width value.
The next option allows users to choose fields for displaying. You can hide or display any field you need. Available fields are Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes and Seconds.
The last option of this tab allows to change texts and configure translations.
